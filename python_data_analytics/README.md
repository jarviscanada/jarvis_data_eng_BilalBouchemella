# Python Data Analytics: Customer Behaviour and Sales Insights

## Introduction
London Gift Shop (LGS) is a UK-based online retailer that sells giftware to both individual customers and wholesalers. Despite operating online for over ten years, the company has seen little revenue growth recently. To improve customer engagement and boost sales, the LGS marketing team wants to use data analytics to better understand how customers shop.

LGS partnered with Jarvis Consulting Group to develop a PoC that explores how data analytics can support their goals. My role was to analyze two years of historical transaction data and extract insights on customer activity, purchasing patterns, seasonality, and customer value. These insights will help the marketing team design targeted campaigns, personalized promotions, and strategies to retain existing customers while attracting new ones.

This PoC demonstrates how data analytics can transform raw transactional data into meaningful business intelligence. The final deliverables include RFM metrics, monthly sales trends, active user behaviour, and insights on new vs. returning customers.

**Technologies and Work Completed**
- Used Jupyter Notebook as the main environment for exploration, analysis, and visualization.
- Processed and analyzed data using Python with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
- Loaded and managed transactional data stored in PostgreSQL, running inside Docker containers to simulate a lightweight data warehouse environment.
- Performed data-wrangling tasks including type casting, handling missing values, feature creation, and deriving monthly/behavioral metrics.
- Applied data-warehouse style thinking by organizing datasets into structured analytical outputs.
- Computed key customer insights, including recency, frequency, monetary value, monthly sales trends, active users, and new vs. returning customers.
- Built visualizations to help the LGS marketing team understand customer behaviour and support data-driven campaign planning.
