# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a Master's student in Data Science and Business Analytics at HEC Montréal and a Computer Science graduate from McGill University, where I focused on data engineering, data analysis, and machine learning. I currently work as a Data Engineer at Jarvis, where I build data pipelines, develop software components, and work with cloud and analytics technologies. I previously worked as a Data Scientist and an IT Technician, using technologies such as Python and Julia to build analytical workflows and automate data tasks, while gaining experience in machine learning, data processing, and system operations. These experiences strengthened my passion for leveraging data, machine learning, and AI to create practical, reliable solutions that address real-world challenges.

# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    description: Built a Linux monitoring agent that collects hardware details and tracks CPU, memory, and disk usage across several machines. Used Bash scripts, Docker, PostgreSQL, and cron to store and centralize system data, helping analyze performance and plan future resource needs.
  
  - name: "Python Customer & Performance Analytics PoC"
    git_url: "/python_data_analytics"
    description: Analyzed two years of e-commerce transaction data to identify customer behavior, purchasing patterns, seasonality, and customer value. Built an analytics pipeline using Python with Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook, connected to PostgreSQL and Docker. Performed data wrangling and feature engineering including type casting, handling missing values, and creating monthly and behavioral metrics to produce structured analytical datasets. Computed RFM metrics, monthly sales trends, and active user insights to distinguish new versus returning customers, and delivered visual insights to support targeted marketing campaigns, personalized promotions, and customer retention strategies.

  - name: "News Coverage Analysis of Gladiator II"
    git_url:
    description: Analyzed news coverage of Gladiator II by collecting hundreds of film-related articles using Python and NewsAPI, applying open coding and manual annotation to classify themes, computing TF-IDF scores to extract key terms, and visualizing coverage trends with JupyterLab and Matplotlib to compare the film's visibility with other releases. This project strengthened my skills in text analysis, feature extraction, data collection pipelines, and collaborative workflow management through regular coordination and shared responsibilities.

  - name: "Hotel Database Application"
    git_url:
    description: Developed a full hotel database system as part of a team project by designing the schema, creating and managing SQL tables, and building a Java application with a user-friendly interface for queries, updates, and operations. Worked closely with teammates where communication and coordination were essential, and took responsibility for organizing tasks, splitting work, and ensuring the database and application components integrated smoothly.
