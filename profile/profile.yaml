summary: I am a Master's student in Data Science and Business Analytics at HEC Montréal and a Computer Science graduate from McGill University. I currently work as a Data Engineer at Jarvis, where I build data pipelines, develop software components, and work with cloud and analytics technologies. Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist and an IT Technician, gaining experience in machine learning, data processing, and system operations. These roles strengthened my passion for leveraging data, machine learning, and AI to create practical, reliable solutions that address real-world challenges.
