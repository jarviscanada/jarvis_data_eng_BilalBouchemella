# Bilal Bouchemella . Jarvis Consulting

I am a Master's student in Data Science and Business Analytics at HEC Montréal and a Computer Science graduate from McGill University, where I focused on data engineering, data analysis, and machine learning. I currently work as a Data Engineer at Jarvis, where I build data pipelines, develop software components, and work with cloud and analytics technologies. I previously worked as a Data Scientist and an IT Technician, using technologies such as Python and Julia to build analytical workflows and automate data tasks, while gaining experience in machine learning, data processing, and system operations. These experiences strengthened my passion for leveraging data, machine learning, and AI to create practical, reliable solutions that address real-world challenges.

**Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BilalBouchemella/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Built a Linux monitoring agent that collects hardware details and tracks CPU, memory, and disk usage across several machines. Used Bash scripts, Docker, PostgreSQL, and cron to store and centralize system data, helping analyze performance and plan future resource needs.


## Highlighted Projects
**News Coverage Analysis of Gladiator II**: Analyzed news coverage of Gladiator II by collecting hundreds of film-related articles with Python and NewsAPI, applying open coding and manual annotation to classify themes, computing TF-IDF scores to extract key terms, and visualizing coverage trends using JupyterLab and Matplotlib to compare the film's visibility with competing releases.

**Hotel Database Application**: Developed a full hotel database system by designing the schema, creating and managing SQL tables, and building a Java application with a user-friendly interface to interact with the database for queries, updates, and operations.
